# Same Game

### Artificial Intelligence - 1st Project

This project consists in developing a Python program which aims to solve different variants of the game Same Game.

In this game there is a rectangular board of arbitrary dimensions, this board is inicially filled with pieces. Each piece can have any of many different colors. The objective of the game is to clear all board pieces by removing them in sets of at least two pieces. Two pieces are considered adjacent if they are connected vertically or horizontally but not diagonally. The set of pieces removed includes all pieces of the same color adjacent between them. It is not possible to remove just a part of the adjacent piece set. Everytime a set is removed the pieces above that set will fall down to fill the cleared space. If a column is entirelly cleared the pieces on the right will shift to the right so that all pieces are connected somehow and there are no empty spaces on the left of the board. The game ends when the board is cleared and a loss means there are no possible moves that can clear the board.
